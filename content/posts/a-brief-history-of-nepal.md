# A Brief History of Nepal

> This is a compilation of my rough notes on my quest to find out the history of the country I'm from. This is more from the historical perspective and not a political one. I will try to keep it as concise as possible.

## Pre-Historic Era

### The Lake 
According to mythology, the Kathmandu Valley (the current capital of the country) was once a vast lake known as Nagdaha, or Serpent Lake, believed to be inhabited by Nagas,
the serpent deities. In the center of this lake, a lotus flower bloomed, and within this lotus, the Swayambhu Jyotirupa appeared as a divine
light. This light was said to be so bright and powerful that it illuminated the entire valley, drawing divine beings, sages, and celestial beings 
to worship it.

Ne Muni, also referred to as Manjushri, upon hearing about the divine light, traveled to the valley from the north (some versions say from China or Tibet).
meditated on the light and understood its significance. To make the valley accessible for pilgrims and suitable for human settlement, he cut through the hills at Chovar Gorge, draining the lake's water and revealing the fertile land beneath. 
This is the legendary origin of Kathmandu.

### Gopal Dynasty - The Cowherds

Historical and mythological sources suggest that Manjushri invited or led the Gopal Dynasty into the Kathmandu Valley. They are believed to have originated from the Indian subcontinent,
specifically from regions south of the Himalayas. The Gopals were pastoralists, primarily cowherds, who settled in the valley because of its lush grasslands. 
They introduced cattle rearing and milk production as their primary means of livelihood, earning respect within the community.
The Gopals likely became rulers due to their pivotal role in sustaining the economy and society through cattle farming,
thereby establishing themselves as the first known rulers in the valley.
