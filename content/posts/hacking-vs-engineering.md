After spending nearly three years in the industry engineering B2B solutions, coming back to grad school felt strange—almost alien. I felt out of place. Nobody here was obsessed with code like we were back in the industry. Nobody seemed to follow what we believed were the best practices. No one thought about scale, no one worried about edge cases. Geez, they weren’t even using the right tools—no CI/CD, no pre-commits, sloppy .gitignore files, barely any linting. 

People were just building whatever they could, however they could.  **It was all about getting things to work, with little to no attention to how well they were built**. It all felt chaotic and careless. Honestly, I didn’t quite like the environment.


Fast forward six months, and there’s been quite a shift in how I perceive things now. Working in the industry had transformed me into an engineer, but little did I realize it came at the cost of my creativity (which I'll mostly refer to as my hacking skill in this post). 

*I had become so programmed to think about every edge case, every “best” design, architecture, and pattern. Should I use a factory here? No, maybe a singleton. But what if I need to extend it later? Maybe the builder pattern is better. I was constantly questioning: Will this scale? Sure, it works for simple cases now, but what happens as things get more complicated? Is there a better solution?*

I’d get so caught up in these tiny details that I’d miss the bigger picture. I’d spiral into analysis paralysis and end up with nothing but my own overthought conclusions about why a solution might not work. I wasn’t even focused on solving the actual problem anymore—I was too busy engineering the solution I thought needed to be perfect.

**Caution: I’m not generalizing that industry will hamper your hacking skills—I’m just sharing my own experience.**

Being back in academia highlighted the importance of hacking again. It revitalized my way of thinking—focusing on getting things done without overthinking every detail beforehand. I started experimenting more, rapidly prototyping ideas without worrying about perfect file names or how to structure my Python modules.

This shift brought me closer to the actual problems I needed to solve. It wasn’t about building the perfect solution anymore—it was about diving in, trying things out, and learning through the process. This flexibility opened the floodgates for new ideas, something I doubt would’ve happened if I’d just continued down the traditional industry path.

The transition from industry to grad school gave me a really good opportunity to see both sides of the spectrum. I’ve come to believe that both are equally important. You need hackers to imagine, to experiment, to push boundaries without worrying about perfection. And you need engineers to take those rough sketches and turn them into robust, scalable realities. I don’t have a preference for one over the other—I’d like to sit right in the middle of that spectrum.

But here’s the thing: with AI code assistants getting ridiculously good, programming is starting to feel more like natural language. The obscure dataclasses, the high-level abstractions—they’re beginning to make less sense in this new landscape. AI has been trained on almost every best software engineering practice humanity has ever created (no github youtube copyrights was harmed here lol). It’s not far-fetched to assume that AI will soon write high-quality code, possibly to the extent that we’ll need fewer engineers.

What once required a whole team of engineers can now be built by just a few people with powerful AI tools. We’re already seeing this shift unfold. So who knows—maybe engineering won’t be the critical thing to worry about anymore. Machines will handle that.

What we’ll need to focus on is creativity. The hacking I mentioned earlier. I believe that in the near future, AI will take over most of the engineering tasks, leaving creativity and innovation as the highest-stakes skills on the table.
