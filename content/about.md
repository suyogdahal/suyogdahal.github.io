Hi there! First of all, welcome to my blog. I'm just an ordinary developer from Kathmandu, Nepal. My experience lies in developing AI-based software solutions. Currently, I'm working as an ML Engineer at [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com), a document-AI company. My day-to-day job involves exploring various ML models for extracting information from documents. In addition to research, I also develop, deploy, and monitor these systems in production.

Before working at Docsumo, while still in college, I, along with a few of my seniors, created a small service-based company called [Kharpann](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kharpann/). We took on projects from multiple domains, including web development, mobile app development, and data science. Additionally, we started [TheClickReader](https://theclickreader.com), where we wrote many articles, blogs, and courses specifically for the data science community. We even began creating courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/856c3f66-1301-4601-99aa-73f5c9dbd619/). However, while producing content was enjoyable, it wasnâ€™t what I wanted to pursue as a career. I was still young and in my undergraduate studies, and I wanted to explore more on the tech side of things. Therefore, I decided to part ways with TheClickReader and join Docsumo.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
