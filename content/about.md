Hi there! Welcome to my blog. I’m just an ordinary developer from Kathmandu, Nepal, with some experience in developing AI-based software solutions. If you’re curious about what kind of content you'll find here, learn more about what to expect from this blog [here](https://suyogdahal.com.np/posts/getting-started/).

Regarding myself, I have recently started my MS in Computer Science at [Old Dominion University (ODU)](https://odu.edu/). Prior to this, I was working as an ML Engineer at [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com), a document-AI company. My day-to-day job involved exploring various ML models for extracting information from documents. In addition to research, I also developed, deployed, and monitored these systems in production.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
