Hi there! Welcome to my blog. Iâ€™m just an ordinary developer from Kathmandu, Nepal, with some experience in developing AI-based software solutions. I have recently started my MS in Computer Science at [Old Dominion University (ODU)](https://odu.edu/). Prior to this, I was working as an ML Engineer at [Docsumo](https://docsumo.com), a document-AI company for almost 3 years. My day-to-day job involved exploring various ML models for extracting information from documents. In addition to research, I also developed, deployed, and monitored these systems in production.
