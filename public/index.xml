      <description>TL;DR: Always use functools.wraps for your decorators.
Decorators in python are wonderful. They let you modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without permanently modifying their source code. I&amp;rsquo;ve used them in several places in my code to add features to my functions. But recently, I came across a weird, or rather interesting, bug that I felt was worth sharing.
The Issue So we had a Flask API that was responsible for ML inference.</description>

      <description>What is it and why is it needed? Last week, I spent some time writing prompts for classifying documents into a fixed set of classes based on their OCR text. I spent some time tweaking and experimenting with the prompt for the model to behave exactly how I wanted it to behave. But prompt tuning, for those who have tried it, knows how painfully daunting it is to make these models behave exactly how you&amp;rsquo;d like them to behave&amp;hellip; that also consistently.</description>

      <description>Hi there! First of all, welcome to my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m just an ordinary developer from Kathmandu, Nepal. My experience lies in developing AI-based software solutions. Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m working as an ML Engineer at Docsumo, a document-AI company. My day-to-day job involves exploring various ML models for extracting information from documents. In addition to research, I also develop, deploy, and monitor these systems in production.
Before working at Docsumo, I ventured into entrepreneurship while still in college.</description>

      <description>Hello to Everyone Reading This, It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I last penned anything down. The last memory I have of writing was during my GRE&amp;rsquo;s Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA) — ah, the good ol&amp;rsquo; days! But let’s set the jokes aside for a moment. I used to write articles and courses for The Click Reader for over a year. However, after moving on from Click Reader, my writing habits took an unexpected hiatus.</description>
