      <description>Decorators in python are wonderful. They let you modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without permanently modifying their source code. I&amp;rsquo;ve used them in several places in my code to add features to my functions. But recently, I came across a weird, or rather interesting, bug that I felt was worth sharing.
